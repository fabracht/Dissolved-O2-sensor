# Dissolved O2 Sensor
This was a side project to implement a new oxygen reading system in the Biochemistry Lab at the State University of Maring√°/Brazil.
The C code was provided by the company that sells the arduino kit.
A few tweaks are still necessary and the final objective, which was to develop a user interface for the lab users is still in progress.
